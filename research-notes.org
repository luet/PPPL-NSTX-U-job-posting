What if you could have an impact on the search for an abundant, safe, affordable and environmentally sound means of generating electricity? This is the goal fusion energy at PPPL and the pace of the research toward that goal has been quickly accelerating in recent years.

[ zero-carbon, abundent, fusion energy 

Do you want to have an impact on the search for fusion energy?
Do you have a background in research and love to write code? 
Are you looking to apply your scientific programming expertise to a novel set of research
problems? If so, Princeton University's Research Computing department is
recruiting a Research Software Engineer to join the fast-growing
Research Software Engineering (RSE) Group.

Mission: And even deeper understanding of the scientific principles that are applied here.
   - This is an important part: not just achieving fusion (almost
     naive) but also, and most importantly, understanding the scientific principles.
   - Is the "probe" also called the apparatus?
   - Can I call it facility?
     
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maybe I could ask PPPL for litterature:
   - about fusion.
   - what do they mean about experiment? and shot?
   - I could write something and just asked for their feedback on it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eliot:
- instrumentation, diagnostic.
  - experimental probe.
- "shot" is part of their culture they always refer to the shot number.

The Verge]] Simply put, "They shot a bunch of lasers at a pellet of
fuel, and more energy was released from that fusion ignition than the
energy of the lasers going in,"

#Q: is that what the NSTX-U experiment do? Shouting lasers?

The fusion achievement that the US Energy Department announced this
week is scientifically significant, but the significance does not
relate primarily to electricity generation

But [[https://sites.google.com/a/pppl.gov/nstx-u/overview?authuser=0][NSTX-U - About NSTX-U]]: 

Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) is yielding research
results that may open an attractive path towards developing fusion
energy as an abundant, safe, affordable and environmentally sound
means of generating electricity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this position, you will be an integral part of the [[https://sites.google.com/a/pppl.gov/nstx-u/][National Spherical Torus Experiment - Upgrade]] (NSTX-U) project at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL).

Experiments run on the experimental probe starts with researchers submitting a proposal. This proposal is reviewed and commented on. When the experiment itself involve many variables that needs to be recorded. All the data generated during the experiment need to be easily available and that data needs to be visualized.
 
Some tools already have been developed in the past for each step of these steps. Some of them 

There are already existing tools that provide the function need by each step of the process.

There already are some software solution 

The initial project for this position will be to build a [modern and flexible] web tool that will help [track,coordinate] the multiple stages of an experiment. [to provide a common and unified interface to the information related to a given experiment.]


In this project you will be part of the [] group at PPPL

Each experiment is called a shot. [check - I think that's what they called it]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project will require a lot of communications

Research on NSTX-U is conducted by a collaborative research team of
physicists and engineers from 30 U.S. laboratories and universities
and 28 international institutions from 11 countries.

This is really good video on what is fusion:

In one of Clancey Rowley's student's dissertation, they call it a "plasma discharge"

Tokamaks use magnetic fields to bottle up plasmas of hydrogen
isotopes, which heats the confined particles to tens of millions of
degrees and causes them to fuse into helium.
